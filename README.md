# athletic_sales_analysis

## Background:

The following code will analyze sales data to gain insights into U.S. cities that have sold the most athletic wear over two years. Additionally, it will analyze the retailers that had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, the day and week that had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear will be determined.  
The code will require functions such as the groupby, pivot_table, resample, and import of csv files. 
This code is available at Github under (https://github.com/algjor/athletic_sales_analysis ).

## Description of Code:
This code was completed using the following steps.
(1) - A repository was created called athletic-sales-analysis in Git hub.
(2) - A starter code named athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code.ipynb was created on the local Git repository and pushed to GitHub.
(3) - The csv files athletic_sales_2020.csv and athletic_sales_2021.csv were imported for the data analysis.
(4) - The csv files were read in as Dataframes.
(5) - The data was then cleaned by checking for any null values.
(6) - The two data frames for sales_2020 and sales_2021 were combined into one dataframe using concantenation.
(7) - The region that sold the most products was analyzed using two methods (groupby and pivot_table functions) with each rendering the same results.
(8) - The region that sold the most sales was analyzed using two methods (groupby and pivot_table functions) with each rendering the same results.
(9) - The retailer that had the most sales was analyzed using two methods (groupby and pivot_table functions) with each rendering the same results.
(10) - The retailer that sold the most women's athletic footwear was analyzed using two methods (groupby and pivot_table functions) with each rendering the same results.
(11) - The day and week with the most women's athletic footwear sales were analyzed using a pivot_table and resample functions.
